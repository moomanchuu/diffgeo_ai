Welcome to the world of Differential Geometry!

The main goal of this project will for me (James) to learn differential geometry. 
However, I am extremely lazy, and taking the time to learn all the prerequisite knowledge takes a long time. 
This fact brought me here; Machines can be useful!

The aim of this project is to construct a ML model that understands differential geometry at it's very core. Eventually, if it becomes good enough, I will have it explain to me string theory. 
I want the model to be able to explain exactly what symbols mean and how they connect together, revealing the relationship on not only what the operators are but why they are used

This model will probably be a combination of: 
- A strong LLM for reading data and explanation
- Mathematical reading comprehension (symbolic / logical)
- Mathematical reasoning and problem solving (logical / proofs)


On the surface, it seems like acquiring data is the easy part and training the hard part; this is correct. 
However, acquiring data will be deceptively more difficult that initially imagined because of the sheeramount of prerequisite knowledge there is to understanding differential geometry. 
Off the top of my head I can think of a couple subjects:
- Set Theory
- Formal Logic / reasoning
- Group Theory
- Linear Algebra
- Real Analysis
- Manifolds (The closest one to diffgeo)

The model will have to comb through all of these concepts before being able to truly understand differential geometry, and put it into the context of math and physics.
